# Task: Completion Rate Tracking

## Description
Implement real-time completion rate tracking and display. This includes percentage calculation, progress visualization, and automatic updates when task states change.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement real-time completion percentage calculation
- [ ] Create completion rate display component in header
- [ ] Add visual progress indicator (progress bar or circular progress)
- [ ] Ensure rate updates automatically on task state changes
- [ ] Handle edge cases (empty list, all tasks completed)
- [ ] Add smooth animations for rate changes
- [ ] Create task count display (total/completed)
- [ ] Implement rate calculation with proper precision
- [ ] Add visual feedback for rate milestones
- [ ] Ensure performance with large task lists

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**: Real-time calculation with DOM updates
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Efficient calculation algorithm for performance
  - Smooth animations for visual feedback
  - Proper handling of edge cases
  - Real-time updates without perceptible delay
  - Accessible progress indicators
  - Proper formatting and display of percentages
- **Files Affected**: `index.html` (adding completion rate JavaScript and CSS)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: JavaScript Core Logic (must be complete)
- [ ] Task 005: Local Storage Integration (must be complete)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: S (Small)
- **Hours**: 3-4 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can be worked on after Tasks 004, 005)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Completion rate calculation working correctly
- [ ] Visual progress indicator implemented
- [ ] Real-time updates on task changes
- [ ] Edge cases handled properly
- [ ] Smooth animations for rate changes
- [ ] Performance optimized for large lists
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Visual design matches overall theme
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
