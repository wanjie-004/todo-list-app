# Task: Performance Optimization

## Description
Optimize application performance including DOM manipulation efficiency, event delegation, memory leak prevention, and handling large task lists effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Optimize DOM manipulation for minimal reflows
- [ ] Implement efficient event delegation patterns
- [ ] Add memory leak prevention and cleanup
- [ ] Optimize for large task lists (1000+ tasks)
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists (if needed)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and debugging
- [ ] Optimize localStorage operations for efficiency
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical features
- [ ] Add requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- [ ] Ensure sub-second response times for all operations

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**: Performance-focused JavaScript optimization
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Minimize DOM operations and reflows
  - Use efficient event delegation
  - Implement proper memory management
  - Use requestAnimationFrame for animations
  - Optimize for both CPU and memory usage
  - Implement performance monitoring
  - Handle edge cases with large datasets
  - Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- **Files Affected**: `index.html` (optimizing JavaScript and CSS)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: JavaScript Core Logic (must be complete)
- [ ] Task 005: Local Storage Integration (must be complete)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 4-6 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can be worked on after Tasks 004, 005)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] DOM manipulation optimized
- [ ] Event delegation implemented efficiently
- [ ] Memory leak prevention in place
- [ ] Performance with large task lists verified
- [ ] Sub-second response times achieved
- [ ] Performance monitoring implemented
- [ ] Memory usage optimized
- [ ] Cross-browser performance tested
- [ ] Documentation added for optimization techniques
