# Task: JavaScript Core Logic

## Description
Implement the core JavaScript logic for task management including data model, CRUD operations, event handling, and DOM manipulation. This provides the foundation for all interactive functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement task data model with proper structure
- [ ] Create CRUD operation functions (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Set up event handling for form submission and user interactions
- [ ] Implement DOM manipulation for dynamic task display
- [ ] Create task ID generation system
- [ ] Add basic error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement proper event delegation
- [ ] Create functions for task state management
- [ ] Add basic debugging and logging capabilities
- [ ] Ensure code is modular and maintainable

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**: Vanilla JavaScript with modular functions
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Use ES6+ features for clean code
  - Implement proper error handling
  - Create modular function structure
  - Use event delegation for efficiency
  - Ensure proper data validation
  - Implement proper scope and closure management
- **Files Affected**: `index.html` (adding JavaScript code)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Task Input Form Component (must be complete)
- [ ] Task 003: Task List Container Component (must be complete)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 6-8 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can be worked on after Tasks 002, 003)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Core JavaScript logic implemented
- [ ] CRUD operations working correctly
- [ ] Event handling properly set up
- [ ] DOM manipulation functioning
- [ ] Data model properly structured
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Code tested and debugged
- [ ] Documentation added as comments
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
