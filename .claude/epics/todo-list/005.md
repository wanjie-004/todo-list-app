# Task: Local Storage Integration

## Description
Implement localStorage integration for data persistence across browser sessions. This includes save/load functions, error handling for storage limits, and data backup/recovery mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement localStorage save functionality
- [ ] Create localStorage load functionality for session restoration
- [ ] Add error handling for storage quota limits
- [ ] Implement data serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Create automatic save on task state changes
- [ ] Add data validation for loaded tasks
- [ ] Implement storage cleanup and maintenance
- [ ] Add fallback handling for storage unavailable
- [ ] Create data backup and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Test data persistence across browser sessions

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**: localStorage API with JSON serialization
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Handle storage quota limitations gracefully
  - Implement proper data validation
  - Use try-catch for error handling
  - Implement data versioning for future compatibility
  - Add storage usage monitoring
  - Create efficient save/load mechanisms
- **Files Affected**: `index.html` (adding localStorage functions)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: JavaScript Core Logic (must be complete)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: S (Small)
- **Hours**: 4-5 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can be worked on after Task 004)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Local storage save/load functionality working
- [ ] Error handling for storage limits implemented
- [ ] Data persistence across sessions verified
- [ ] Automatic save on state changes working
- [ ] Data validation and error recovery in place
- [ ] Storage usage monitoring implemented
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tested
- [ ] Performance optimized for storage operations
- [ ] Documentation added for storage functions
