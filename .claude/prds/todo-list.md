# PRD: todo-list

## Executive Summary

A minimal yet elegant personal task management application designed for individual users. This MVP focuses on delivering a clean, intuitive interface for basic todo list functionality with an emphasis on simplicity and visual appeal.

## Problem Statement

Users need a straightforward, distraction-free tool for managing personal tasks without the complexity of advanced project management features. Current solutions often overwhelm users with unnecessary functionality or lack the aesthetic appeal that encourages daily use.

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona: Individual Task Manager
- **Name**: Alex
- **Role**: Professional managing personal tasks
- **Goals**: Stay organized with minimal friction
- **Pain Points**: Complex interfaces, feature bloat, poor UX

### User Journeys

**Adding a Task**
- As a user, I want to quickly add tasks so I can capture ideas immediately
- Acceptance Criteria: Task can be added in under 3 seconds

**Managing Tasks**
- As a user, I want to view all my tasks in one place so I can prioritize my work
- Acceptance Criteria: All tasks visible in a clean, scannable format

**Completing Tasks**
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so I can track my progress
- Acceptance Criteria: Visual feedback when task is completed

**Task Completion Rate**
- As a user, I want to see my completion percentage so I can stay motivated
- Acceptance Criteria: Real-time calculation and display of completion rate

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Task Management**
- Create new tasks with minimal input (task name only required)
- Read/view all tasks in a single list
- Update task details (name, status)
- Delete tasks permanently
- Toggle task completion status

**User Interface**
- Clean, minimalist design with modern aesthetics
- Responsive layout for desktop use
- Visual distinction between pending and completed tasks
- Real-time task completion rate display
- Intuitive controls for all CRUD operations

**Data Persistence**
- Local storage for task data
- Data persistence across browser sessions
- No backend server required

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Sub-second response time for all operations
- Smooth animations and transitions
- No page reloads required for CRUD operations

**Usability**
- Intuitive interface requiring no learning curve
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Clear visual feedback for all actions

**Reliability**
- Data integrity maintained across sessions
- Graceful handling of browser storage limitations
- No data loss during normal usage

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- **Task Completion Rate**: 80%+ of created tasks are marked as complete
- **User Engagement**: Daily active usage with consistent task creation
- **Task Velocity**: Average of 5-10 tasks created per session
- **Completion Time**: Tasks completed within 24 hours of creation

### Key Metrics
- **Task Creation Success Rate**: 99%+ successful task creation
- **User Retention**: 70%+ return users within 7 days
- **Interface Satisfaction**: User rating of 4/5 or higher for simplicity
- **Performance**: <500ms response time for all operations

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Implementation limited to HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
- No backend server or database required
- Must work in modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No external dependencies beyond standard web technologies

### Timeline Constraints
- MVP development within 2 weeks
- Focus on core functionality only
- No advanced features in initial release

### Resource Constraints
- Single developer effort
- No dedicated design resources
- Minimal testing infrastructure

### Assumptions
- Users have modern web browsers
- Local storage is available and enabled
- Users prefer simplicity over advanced features
- Desktop-first design (mobile not required for MVP)

## Out of Scope

### Features Not Included
- User accounts or authentication
- Task sharing or collaboration
- Task categories or labels
- Due dates or reminders
- Task priorities
- Search functionality
- Data export/import
- Cloud synchronization
- Mobile application
- Advanced filtering or sorting
- Recurring tasks
- Task dependencies
- Attachments or notes
- Themes or customization

### Technical Limitations
- No backend API integration
- No database management
- No user authentication system
- No real-time collaboration features
- No offline synchronization

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Modern web browser with local storage support
- No third-party libraries or frameworks required

### Internal Dependencies
- None - this is a standalone application
- No integration with existing systems
- No shared components or services

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- Single-page application (SPA)
- Client-side only architecture
- Local storage for data persistence
- Event-driven user interface

### Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Application logic and DOM manipulation
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **Local Storage API**: Data persistence
- **No frameworks**: Vanilla JavaScript implementation

### Data Model
```javascript
{
  tasks: [
    {
      id: "unique_identifier",
      name: "Task description",
      completed: false,
      createdAt: "2025-09-06T11:35:06Z",
      completedAt: null
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Features Implementation
- **Task Creation**: Simple input field with add button
- **Task Display**: Clean list with checkbox and delete button
- **Task Completion**: Toggle checkbox with visual feedback
- **Task Deletion**: Remove button with confirmation
- **Completion Rate**: Real-time percentage calculation and display
- **Local Storage**: Automatic save on all operations

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
- Manual testing of all CRUD operations
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Local storage functionality testing
- User interface usability testing
- Performance testing with large task lists

### Quality Checks
- [ ] All CRUD operations work correctly
