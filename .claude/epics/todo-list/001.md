# Epic: todo-list

## Overview

A single-page, client-side todo list application implemented with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application will provide a clean, minimalist interface for personal task management with local storage persistence and real-time completion rate tracking.

## Architecture Decisions

### Single-File Architecture
- **Decision**: Implement as a single HTML file containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Rationale**: Maximum simplicity, no build step, easy deployment and sharing
- **Trade-off**: Limited code organization vs. extreme simplicity

### Vanilla JavaScript Implementation
- **Decision**: Use vanilla JavaScript without any frameworks
- **Rationale**: No dependencies, minimal overhead, direct DOM control
- **Trade-off**: Manual state management vs. framework convenience

### Local Storage Only
- **Decision**: Use browser localStorage for data persistence
- **Rationale**: No backend required, works offline, zero infrastructure
- **Trade-off**: Device-specific storage vs. cloud synchronization

### Event-Driven UI Architecture
- **Decision**: Direct DOM manipulation with event delegation
- **Rationale**: Immediate feedback, minimal abstraction, predictable behavior
- **Trade-off**: Manual DOM management vs. virtual DOM efficiency

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Core Application Structure**
- Single HTML file with semantic markup
- Embedded CSS using custom properties for theming
- Embedded JavaScript with modular function organization
- Event delegation for efficient event handling

**User Interface Components**
- Header with title and completion rate display
- Task input form with add button
- Task list container with individual task items
- Task item structure: checkbox, task name, delete button
- Clean visual distinction between completed and pending tasks

**State Management**
- In-memory tasks array for current session
- localStorage integration for persistence
- Real-time completion rate calculation
- Automatic save on all state changes

### Backend Services

**No Backend Required**
- Client-side only architecture
- No API endpoints or server-side processing
- No database or external service dependencies

**Data Model**
```javascript
{
  tasks: [
    {
      id: "unique_timestamp",
      name: "Task description",
      completed: false,
      createdAt: "2025-09-06T11:41:15Z",
      completedAt: null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Week 1)
1. **HTML Structure and Basic Styling**
   - Semantic markup for accessibility
   - CSS custom properties for consistent theming
   - Responsive layout with CSS Grid/Flexbox

2. **JavaScript Core Logic**
   - Task CRUD operations implementation
   - Local storage integration
   - Event handling and DOM manipulation
   - Completion rate calculation

### Phase 2: User Experience Polish (Week 1)
1. **User Interface Refinements**
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Visual feedback for user actions
   - Keyboard shortcuts implementation
   - Mobile-responsive adjustments

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient DOM manipulation
   - Event delegation optimization
   - Memory leak prevention

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Week 2)
1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing
   - Performance testing with large datasets
   - User experience validation
   - Edge case handling

2. **Final Polish**
   - Code optimization and cleanup
   - Documentation and comments
   - Accessibility improvements

## Task Breakdown

- [ ] #2 HTML Structure and Basic Styling
- [ ] #3 Task Input Form Component  
- [ ] #4 Task List Container Component
- [ ] #5 JavaScript Core Logic
- [ ] #6 Local Storage Integration
- [ ] #7 Task Item Interactions
- [ ] #8 Completion Rate Tracking
- [ ] #9 User Experience Polish
- [ ] #10 Performance Optimization
- [ ] #11 Quality Assurance and Final Polish

## Success Criteria

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Task Creation**: <500ms from input to display
- **Task Completion**: <200ms for status toggle and UI update
- **Data Persistence**: <100ms for localStorage operations
- **Completion Rate**: Real-time calculation without perceptible delay

### Quality Gates
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable code with proper documentation
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with clear visual feedback
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works consistently across target browsers
- **Data Integrity**: No data loss during normal operations

### Acceptance Criteria
- All CRUD operations function correctly
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Completion rate calculation is accurate
- Interface is responsive and visually appealing
- Application works without console errors

## Estimated Effort

### Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 1 (Core)**: 1 week
- **Phase 2 (Polish)**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 3 (QA)**: 2-3 days

### Resource Requirements
- **Development**: Single developer
- **Design**: Built-in (no dedicated designer)
- **Testing**: Manual testing by developer
- **Infrastructure**: Static file hosting

### Critical Path Items
1. Core CRUD functionality (highest priority)
2. Local storage integration (high priority)
3. User interface components (medium priority)
4. Performance optimization (medium priority)
5. Quality assurance (lower priority)

### Risk Mitigation
- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to MVP requirements
- **Technical Complexity**: Simple architecture minimizes complexity
- **Timeline Pressure**: Phased approach with clear milestones
- **Quality Issues**: Incremental testing and validation
